This game is a simple version of Hangman, where players try to guess a hidden word letter by letter. At the start, a random word is selected from a predefined list, and the player sees the word represented as blank spaces. The player guesses letters, and each correct guess fills in the corresponding blanks. If they guess incorrectly, they lose one of their six lives, represented by different stages of a hangman drawing. The game continues until the player either guesses the entire word correctly (winning) or loses all lives (losing).
